# Serenyx - Your Pet's Joyful Companion

A comforting, joyful companion app for pet owners - where every interaction feels like a warm hug.

## 🌟 About Serenyx

Serenyx is a sanctuary where pet owners can engage in lighthearted, positive interactions with a digital version of their pet, track their well-being, and reflect on their mood.
